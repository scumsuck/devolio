                <h2>Da rules:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>I can ignore submissions from annoying people.  Annoying people include MAGAs, gender criticals, (un)ironic varg fanboys, and anti/proship discoursers.</li>
                <li>You must acknowledge ðŸ‘† RPF.  You donâ€™t have to like it.  You donâ€™t have to create it.  You just have to not be a dick to people who happen to create fanart and fanfic about musicians.</li>
                <li>No gatekeeping.  Everyone is welcome no matter what genres they like.</li>
                <li>I know 80% of celebrities are jackasses, and that applies to rock music too.  You can like the music and think the musician is a total jackass.  If youâ€™re like, a fan of Megadeth Iâ€™m not gonna automatically assume you share all of Dave Mustaineâ€™s IRL views.  If you like The Beatles, Iâ€™m not gonna assume you like beating your wife.  If your page is full of like intentionally labelled nazi black metal or some shit, in which the music and lyrics are meant to be propaganda, Iâ€™m probably ignoring you though.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you donâ€™t like these guidelines, thatâ€™s fine.  Make your own web listing!  Itâ€™s free!</p>
